# oxm10

This module is made mainly to encrypt malware samples.
Since I want to be able to copy the samples around and not care
about false-positives I build this module.

The secrecy was not the main design goal, so be careful.
I guess it should be fine to use, it is definitely not build
considering timing attacks or memory safety. So use it carefully!

It should be compatible with openssl, check docs or tests for more info.

Feedback is appreciated.
